            Hello world! My name is Mary Susan, I am an orangutan psychologist that graduated from John Hopkins Department of Psychological 
            & Brain sciences (My picture is to the left of this text). I have 3 siblings, one of them is an engineer, another is a physicist, and the eldest one isn't as intellectually inclined.
            There has been some dispute over Orangutans taking some human jobs, but these are completely unjustified, Orangutans are perfectly capable of providing services
            to the same degree a human can, and I am here to provide those services to you with a PHD normally given to humans, given to me as an Organgutan,
            for psychiatry. I have recently graduated but that is irrelevant, I am talking to you through the internet as I am looking for clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            I charge a modest upfront cost of 100$ for counseling, considering you're getting the best of the best you're getting a good bargain, and this upfront price
            pays for an entire apointment no matter how long the apointment is. This allows me to really connect with you on a deeper level with extended sessions and you not having
            to worry about how much each hour is costing you. The price is nonnegotiable. 
            Feel free to talk to me in my gmail account at sarysusanbestpsychologist@gmail.com, if you needed evidence of my diploma it is to the right of this text,
            unfortunately there had to be some censorship for privacy reasons.
